# Let's Make Salad!

This was a short-lived project in which I started creating a game written in
Golang with raylib. The game / demo procedurally generates a map (based on a
seed), and then beings and items get randly added to it. You can zoom around
the map, or make it full screen.

The original idea was to make a peaceful and relaxing colony simulator in which
all of the food is vegan.

## How to run the demo / game

```
git clone https://github.com/leaf-node/lest-make-salad
cd lets-make-salad

go run .
```

or with a seed string of your choosing:

```
go run . any-seed-string
```

The raylib depdendency comes with C code, so it may take a few minutes to
compile the very first time.

## Controls

`f` for full screen, `m` for maximized window, arrow keys for moving the view
of the map, `+` to zoom in, `-` to zoom out, `esc` to quit

## About the code

The map is created by multiplying two different freqencies of two-dimensional
OpenSimplex noise together. Land features are determined by the height /
amplituide of each square.
